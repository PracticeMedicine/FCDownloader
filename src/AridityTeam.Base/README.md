# AridityTeam.Base
**Made with .NET 9 (C# 12.0)**

Hi, this is the `AridityTeam.Base` project. Usually I would call this "a small-collection of low level ("base") routines from Beta Fortress Client".
I mean those base routine codes from BFClient can literally be just doing the "drag-and-drop into the other project" thing. That's how I did it.
